### Capstone-2-Proposal
Detecting Emotions from Text

##### Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to develop a model that is able to classify the tone of reddit posts as positive, negative, or neutral.  

**Follow Up Goals:** 
I'd like to develop a model that can correctly classify the emotion of each post. I'd also like to look at the likelihoods of each subreddit, given the text within each post, and explore similarities across subreddits.  This could help recommend subreddits to people, based on their posts. 


##### About the Dataset
The dataset came from a Google Research study called "Goemotions" (link below).  The data is comprised of 58,000 reddit comments that were labeled for 27 different emotions.
